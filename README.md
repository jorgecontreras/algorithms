# Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in Python. Each algorithm is implemented in its own file and includes test cases to verify its correctness.

## Directory Structure

- `search/`: Contains search algorithms.
  - `binary_search.py`: Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
  - `bfs.py`: Implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
  - `dfs.py`: Implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
- `sort/`: Contains sorting algorithms.
  - `merge_sort.py`: Implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
  - `quick_sort.py`: Implementation of the quick sort algorithm.
- `pathfind/`: Contains pathfinding algorithms.
  - `a_star.py`: Implementation of the A* search algorithm.

## Usage

Each file can be run independently to test the corresponding algorithm. For example, to run the binary search implementation, use the following command:

```sh
python search/binary_search.py
```
